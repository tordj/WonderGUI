PRE0 - Release
==============

	Working/reliable Menubar/Combobox/Menu.
	Implement TableList.
	Lasso on PackList.
	
	Simple test of all widgets.
	Clean out legacy classes.

	Final decision on prefix camelcase.
	EventHandler in Base, not in Root.


PRE1 - Release
==============

*	Replace WgCheckbox and WgRadiobutton with WgStateButton + WgRadioGroup.
*	Refactor WgHScrollbar & WgVScrollbar -> WgScrollbar.

*	Refactor cursor.
*	Refactor fonts.
*	Refactor TextProps.

*	Correctly working textfields.
*	Correctly working valuefields.



Things to fix
=============

* Can we cast back-and-forth between Objects and interfaces for objects with WgIWidgetHolder interface?
* WgPopupLayer should have AddPopupWidget() instead of OpenPopup() etc (see ModalLayer for ref).
* Pools deallokeras automatiskt när alla medlemmar försvinner. WgBase hålla en medlem tills exit.

* Turn wg_iconholder into an interface.
* Turn wg_interface_valueholder into three different interfaces (static/modif/edit).
* Assign smartpointers from weakpointers.
* Turn WgTextProp into normal Objects.
* Turn Cast() into DynamicCast() and StaticCast().
* OnEvent() should ALWAYS call the superclass. Now it doesn't for Button, Checkbox, Menu and Scrollbar.

FOCUS
=====

* Fixa repeat på character input.
* Hur ska vi lösa _onMaskRects() ???
* Keyboard focus vid modal.
* Wdg_Layout.
* Cut/Copy/Paste-support.
* WgCharBuffer m.fl. saknar metoder för Size, Link och kanske mer...


FIX GIZMOS
==========
v Animation	(untested)
v Button
v Checkbox	(still to fix: WidthForHeight() )
v Dragbars
v Editline	(untested)
v Editvalue
v Radiobutton
v Refreshbutton (untested)
v Shader 	(untested)
  Table
v Tablist	(untested, missing requesting TICKS!)
  Combobox
  Text
v Value		(untested, needs event-posting!)
  Menu
  Menubar
  Treeview



TO BE TESTED
============

* Tangentbordshantering i WgEventHandler.
* Tab-order.

PAPERCUTS
=========

* WgGfxDeviceSDL should be able to take a SDL_Surface directly as canvas.
* Gizmos needs more constructors for convenience!


KEYBOARD SUPPORT
================

* Sliders should have support for arrow keys (up/down or left/right depending on orientation)
  and home/end.


FONT SYSTEM
===========

* WgBitmapGlyphs handle baseline and ascend correctly so we can mix bitmap glyphs with vector glyphs with good result.
* Separate struct and bitmap-cache for vector glyphs so we can get glyph info without touching the cache.
* TTF: Try to use multiple size-objects so we don't have to set size all the time.
* VectorGlyphs: Limit cache size!
* WgBitmapGlyphs: Currently uses linespacing for height... :(

* WgGlyph should have its own virtual blit method and we should use it to support fake ellipsis by blitting '...'


TEXTSYSTEM
==========
* Handle linebreaks so that cursor will fit on line if text is editable.
* Handle linebreaks so that EOL/EOF characters will fit if displayed.

underlining
-----------
* Handle underline in a better way, taking TTF offset and thickness into account.
* Start/stop select size and color correctly according to props.


CURSOR
======

* Change how cursor is stretched/scaled and/or offset. Offsets are in fixed pixelsizes but needs to be relative or something to work with the scaling.
* Make sure all parameters can be set through XML.
* Build cursor instance into text object (or somewhere similar).


GFXDEVICES
==========

* SDL: Correctly working tint.
* Review WgSurfaceGL for consistency.


LAYOUT
======
* PosX()/PosY() should be renamed OfsX()/OfsY() with new PosX()/PosY() methods returning parent relative position, not origo offset?
