	 * @brief Simple abstract representation of a bitmap image.

	 * @author Tord Jansson
	 * @date 26/01/21
	 * 
	 * PixelBuffer is a small, simple class for low-level access to the pixels of a Surface in
	 * a way that is independent of the underlying architecture.
	 * 
	 * PixelBuffers can not be created directly and their members are read-only. Only the 
	 * pixels (pointed to by the member pPixels) can be modified.
	 * 
	 * They are created by the Surface to which they are connected and either, depending
	 * on type of Surface, allocates a buffer for reading/writing pixels from/to the Surface
	 * OR provides direct access to the Surface pixels.
	 * 
	 * Either way you allocate a PixelBuffer by calling Surface::allocPixelBuffer() on the Surface
	 * you want to manipulate. This sets up a PixelBuffer that is mapped to a rectangular region
	 * of the Surface.
	 * 
	 * If you want to read the Surfaces' pixels you then call Surface::pushPixels() to make the Surface 
	 * copy its pixels to the buffer. This step is unnecessary if the underlying architecture 
	 * allows direct access to the pixels of the Surface, but harmless 
	 * (just returns immediately) and should always be performed to prepare the buffer for reading.
	 * 
	 * If you will just write pixels, not read, and will fill the buffer with new pixels, you can skip pushPixels()
	 * and possibly gain performance.
	 * 
	 * In order to update the Surface with the pixels in the PixelBuffer, call Surface::pullPixels() to make
	 * the Surface pull in the Pixels from the buffer.
	 * 
	 * Lastly, you need to free the memory reserved by the PixelBuffer by calling Surface::freePixelBuffer().
	 * Failing to do so will leak memory since Surfaces don't keep track of their PixelBuffers and won't delete
	 * them when destroyed.
	 * 
	 * A PixelBuffer is strongly tied to the Surface it was created from and may not be used in any call
	 * to any other Surface. So you can not push pixels from one Surface into a PixelBuffer and then pull 
	 * them into another as a way of copying content between them. Use Surface::copy() for that.

	/**
	 * @class NinePatch
	 * @author Tord Jansson
	 * @date 26/01/21
	 * 
	 * A struct that specifies a block of graphics and how it shall be copied, what
	 * parts of the block that should be stretched (if needed) and what parts should not.
	 * 
	 * A nine-patch specifies a rectangle of a Surface divided into 9 different areas:
	 * 
	 * - the four corners (northwest, northeast, southeast and south west.
	 * - the four sides between the corners (north, east, south and west).
	 * - the center.
	 * 
	 * When the block of grahics is copied to an area that is larger than the block itself,
	 * it is stretched in the following way:
	 * 
	 * - the four corners of the block are copied to the four corners of the destination (no stretching).
	 * - the north and south sides are stretched horizontally to fill the space between their corners.
	 * - the west and east sides are stretched vertically to fill the space between the corners.
	 * - the center is stretched to fill the area between the four sides.
	 * 
	 * Additionally, one extra rectangular area can be specified to not be stretched, this is what is called
	 * the 'rigid part' of the NinePatch. This is more seldom used, but is useful if you for example wants to
	 * create speech bubble like the ones used in comics. You might want the speech bubble to be able to stretch
	 * to nicely fit the text, but it also has a tail or arrow pointing to the speaker, which should not be stretched.
	 * 
	 * @var block				The rectangular area of the block of pixels to copy.
	 * @var frame				Specifies the size of the frame building up the corners and sides.
	 * @var rigidPartXOfs		Start of the rigid part along the X-axis, from the beginning of the block (block.x).
	 * @var rigidPartXLength	Length of the rigid part along the X-axis.
	 * @var rigidPartXSections	Top, center, bottom or any combination of these, OR:ed together. Specifying what
	 * 							sections should be rigid horizontally.
	 * @var rigidPartYOfs		Start of the rigid part along the Y-axis, from the beginning of the block (block.y).
	 * @var rigidPartYLength	Length of the rigid part along the Y-axis.
	 * @var rigidPartYSections	Left, center, right or any combination of these, OR:ed together. Specifying what
	 * 							sections should be rigid horizontally.
